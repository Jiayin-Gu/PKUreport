\par {\large First of all, I am grateful to Prof. H. T. Quan for his invitation that I got such an valuable opportunity to carry out my postdoctoral research in his group at Peking University. I am indebted to Dr. Jin Chen for his continuous support as a consultant about tensor networks, and Prof. Pierre Gaspard for his discussions and encouragement in the research. I would also like to thank my colleagues, Fan Zhang, Jinfu Chen, Yu-Xin Wu, Jihui Pei and many others. The pleasant interaction with them greatly enriched my daily life during the last two years. Finally but particularly, the financial support from Boya Postdoctoral Fellowship of Peking University and National Science Foundation of China under the Grants No. 12147162 is acknowledged.}
