\chapter{Fluctuation Theorem}\label{chap:FT}


\par Fluctuation theorem is one of the greatest triumphs in the search for general statements regarding the dynamics of systems far from equilibrium. It represents a collection of relations in similar structure, concerning the comparison between the probabilities of forward and time-reversed trajectories. These relations are as a consequence of microreversibility, a fundamental symmetry of Nature. They can be considered as a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics. Close to equilibrium, the fluctuation theorem reduces to the fluctuation-dissipation relations such as the Green-Kubo relation for the transport coefficient. Moreover, they also implies the Onsager reciprocal relations as well as the generalized nonlinear ones up to arbitrary order. In this chapter, we give a very detailed analytical derivation of two most well-known relations, the Jarzynski equality and the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem.
